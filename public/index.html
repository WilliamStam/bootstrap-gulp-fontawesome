    <h2>Folder structure</h2>
    <p>
        All my stuff lives in the "app" folder. i then point my web server to a "public" folder. but my stuff is server
        side. for static sites you will probably look to have a dist folder.
    </p>
    <p>
        even my "static" files go through the backend hence why i output them in "app".
    </p>

    <p>
        the basics of this are "your working files in 1 folder", they get processed, and dumped into another folder
    </p>
    <p>
        your working files in "assets" (probably should be "source" tho) and the output in static (should probably go
        into public)
    </p>
    <h3>styles.scss</h3>
    <p> i like keeping my files small, easier to work on. so i devized this folder name as a file name approach. makes
        it easier when i only want to edit the toolbar stuff not to go through a 1000 line file</p>
    <p>
        inside assets/css/styles.scss is a file variables.scss. look in the node_modules/bootstrap/scss/_variables.scss
        file for all the bs variables. add them to the asssets/css/variables file to override the bootstrap ones.
    </p>
    <h3>libraries.js</h3>
    <p>
        i do something similar to the styles for the js files. only there isnt an "import" facility in js so i use a
        list (array) of file names for it to concat and it outputs a single file with all of these
    </p>
    <hr>
    <p>
        how do i use this?
    </p>
    <p>
        run "<code>npm install</code>"" from the root folder (where the package.json file lives)<br>
        this will create a node_modules folder with a bunch of crap in it
    </p>
    <p>
        gulp should now be installed. test it by running "<code>gulp build</code>"
    </p>
    <hr>
    <p>you should now get an app/static folder. refresh this page. should get bootstrap running with some js</p>
    <p>
        bootstrap will now be in static/css/styles.css and static/js/libraries.js so when deploying to the server dont
        include the nod_modules Folder
    </p>
    <p>
        if you want it to auto run "<code>gulp build</code>" for you while you are working on the css / js files start
        off by typing "<code>gulp watch</code>". now whenever you edit a file in assets it will com,pile for you
        automaticaly. if you need to force it for whatever reason do <code>gulp build</code>
    </p>
    <p>
        i included font aweosme in this. https://fontawesome.com/icons?d=gallery&s=brands,light,regular,solid&m=free
    </p>
    <p>
        gulp build will also copy the fonts to your static folder if it goes right.. you should see an icon here
    </p>
    <p>
        <i class="fas fa-check-circle fa-3x text-success"></i>
    </p>
    <p>
        edit: app\assets\css\styles.scss\font-awesome\font-awesome.scss if you need to change the path
    </p>
    <p>
        please note, this IS a basturdized quick sneak at what you can do with it. you will have to have different
        folder structuresd to this. edit the gulp file accordingly
